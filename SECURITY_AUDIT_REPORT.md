## Security Audit Report

### Comet DevX Suite - Partial Security and Code Quality Audit

**Audit Scope:** CLI, TypeScript SDK, Python library, Hardhat plugin, Scenario toolkit.


---

### Executive Summary

This audit identified critical security and code-quality issues in non-contract components of the Comet DevX Suite. High-severity issues primarily concerned hard-coded secrets, insecure private key handling, and network-dependent testing practices. All identified high-severity vulnerabilities have since been addressed, significantly enhancing the security posture and reliability of the repository.

### Detailed Findings

| Severity   | Location                                      | Description                                          | Recommendation                                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**   | `packages/cli/src/index.ts`                   | Templates contained example private keys.            | Require private keys through environment variables.   |
| **High**   | `packages/hardhat-comet/hardhat.config.ts`    | Hard-coded Infura API key present.                   | Load RPC URLs or API keys from environment variables. |
| **High**   | `packages/sdk/test/Comet.spec.ts`             | Tests utilized real RPC endpoints and private keys.  | Adopt mocked providers and dummy wallets.             |
| **High**   | `packages/python-sdk/src/comet_devx/comet.py` | Transaction methods rely on internal `_private_key`. | Explicitly pass private keys as parameters.           |
| **Medium** | CLI argument parsing                          | Insufficient validation for project name/template.   | Enhance validation with clear error handling.         |
| **Medium** | Hardhat tasks                                 | Addresses hard-coded for funding test accounts.      | Parameterize addresses using environment variables.   |

### Additional Recommendations

* Ensure all sensitive credentials, keys, and tokens are exclusively managed through environment variables or secure secret management services. Never commit sensitive details to source control.
* Expand unit test coverage to include comprehensive testing for CLI utilities and scenario scripts.
* Regularly conduct dependency updates and vulnerability scans using tools like `npm audit` for JavaScript packages and `pip list --outdated` for Python packages.
* Clearly document all required environment variables and their usage instructions in package-specific README files for developer convenience and clarity.
