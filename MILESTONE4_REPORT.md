# Milestone 4 Report

This milestone integrated security tooling and completed a partial audit of the Comet DevX Suite.

## Completed Work
- Added static analysis and fuzz testing checks to the scenario framework CI pipeline.
- Underwent a third-party partial audit covering the CLI, SDK, and Hardhat plugin.
- Removed all hard-coded secrets and replaced them with environment variables.
- Updated tests to use mocked providers so they run without network access.
- Produced a public security audit report summarizing findings and fixes.

## Next Steps
- Keep dependencies up to date and run regular security scans.
- Expand fuzz test coverage across scenarios and plugins.
- Publish guides for integrating security checks into Comet-based projects.
